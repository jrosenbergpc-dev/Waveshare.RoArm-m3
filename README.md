DLL Library Project
==============================

Designed to help others integrate the use and control of the WaveShare RoArm Robot Arms in their projects.
Standardizes the Command set for C# allowing easy integration and the use of Enums to determine which command to use, 
the commands can output automatically in json format and it has support for automatically converting degrees to radian which is what the RoArm devices use.

See my other projects for more use cases with RoArm Robots!
